    <p className= {classes.rules}>Randix is a a two-player game, where the players take turns removing pieces from the board.
    The goal is to force the other player to remove the last piece. On your turn you may remove
    as many sequentially pieces as you like either horizontally or vertically.
    You must remove at least one piece on your turn and as many as you want from that row or column (but not both)
    unless you encounter an obstacle that blocks your path.</p>
    <p className= {classes.rules}>Select the pieces you want to remove and press the Remove button to remove them from your board.</p>
    <p className= {classes.rules}>Randix is variant of the popular math game TacTix played in a NxN board. In this variation however,
    pieces are placed randomly on the board. There are also obstacles blocking the path and preventing players from cutting a whole row or column.
